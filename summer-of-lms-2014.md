# The Summer of LMS 2014

We're undertaking a concerted effort to increase stability, polish the user experience, and improve documentation.

Some particular work items:

- <span class="label label-danger">In Progress</span> Virtualization support for Scala 2.11: 
  We're investigating if we can replace our compiler fork with a set of macros.

- <span class="label label-warning">In Progress</span> Scheduling performance improvements: 
  Incorporate modifications from the Spiral team

- <span class="label label-warning">In Progress</span> Tutorials and teaching materials:
  LMS has a learning curve - we need to educate our users better!

- <span class="label label-primary">Almost Done</span> Randomized tests with ScalaCheck.
  
- <span class="label label-success">Done</span> Travis build infrastructure: make sure our pull requests are tested automatically.

- <span class="label label-success">Done</span> Website updates: future-proof our online presence.
